# CS200 (September 2021 - June 2022)
CS200, or Programming With a Purpose, is the second course in the AHS Computer Science Pre-Professional Program. It is a project-based and team-oriented class, and we worked with languages including Python, Java, HTML, and JavaScript. We also utilized modules such as Flask, OpenCV, Java Swing, Logger, and Numpy. 

In this class, I led a four-person team to program a robot to run autonomously using computer vision. We worked according to the Agile-SCRUM method, in which I was the Scrum Master and one of two primary programmers.

Here is a summary of the contents of this repository:

## Project 1: Straight Line (October 2021)
Assembled a robot with a Raspberry Pi 3b+ processor and programmed it to move forward, backward, left, and right using an object-oriented, abstracted structure involving both a Motor and Robot class. For this project, the robot had to move perfectly forward in a straight line for 2 feet, meaning that we had to balance its left and right motors to ensure its path would not be skewed. We also had to find a conversion factor for how many seconds the motors had to be active for the robot to move 1ft.

The code for this project can be found in the [Project 1 Folder](https://github.com/jnnchi/CS200/tree/main/project1).

## Project 2: Traverse Maze (November 2021)
For this project, we had to further test our robot's precision by programming it to successfully complete a preset maze path. This allowed us to tune our robot's ability to turn and move straight so that the following projects would be more successful.

## Project 3: Web Control Using Flask (November 2021)
We created a Flask API to allow users to run the robot through any browser and any computer that is connected to the same WiFi as the Raspberry Pi. View our documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o0M4B9gvexxTvWWVfs1vIguKFfLGcg4x77M757j3ddU/edit?usp=sharing).
