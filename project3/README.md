# PROJECT 3: Allowing the User to Run the Robot from Any Browser Using Flask (November 2021)
So far, we assembled a robot with a Raspberry Pi 3b+ processor and programmed it to move forward, backward, left, and right in Python. It can also run a maze! Now, we used the *Flask* web framework to allow users to run this website from any device at any time, as long as the robot is on and the user is connected to the same WiFi as the Pi. Our interface has controls to make the robot turn left and right and move forward and backwards any specified distance.

```python
# python :)
print("Run our code using the app.py file!")
```

Here is the website for this project:
