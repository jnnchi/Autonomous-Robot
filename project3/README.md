# PROJECT 3: Allowing the User to Run the Robot from Any Browser Using Flask (November 2021)
So far, we assembled a robot with a Raspberry Pi 3b+ processor and programmed it to move forward, backward, left, and right in Python. It can also run a maze! Now, we used the **Flask** web framework to allow users to run the robot from any device at any time, as long as the robot is on and the user is connected to the same WiFi as the Pi, simply by typing a URL into their browser. One such URL that would move the robot forward a distance of 2 feet is: http://192.168.1.243:7777/fwd?d=2
