# PROJECT 4: Java User Interface (November 2021)
We built a Graphical User Interface using Java Swing to make our program more user friendly. The interface has forward, back, turn left, and turn right buttons that the user can press to control the robot.

```python
# python :)
print("Open the app.py, motor.py, and robot.py files to see our backend code!")
```

```java
// java :)
class UseCCC {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Download the Interface.java file to run the code!");
    }
}
```

We also have a website for our company, which we built using HTML and CSS.

```html
<!-- HTML :) -->
<a href="https://cccproject4.jenniferchiou.repl.co/" class="website" Check it out here!</a>
<p>Be sure to click "About" on our site to see our customer presentation!</p>
```

```css
/* CSS :) */
.website {
    background-image: url("welovecoding.jpg");
    background-color: #CCC;
}
```
